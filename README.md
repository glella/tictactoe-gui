# tictactoe - GUI
tic-tac-toe game in Rust with a GUI using the awesome ggez library.

AI uses Minimax algorithm with Alpha Beta pruning to pick the best move.
TODO: need to dumb AI down so the AI is beatable and is more fun to play against, rather than just an exercise. Perhaps adding a levels config limiting depth of minimax search and picking some random moves.

Human player starts first with X. AI plays with O.

GUI heavily inspired by Alexander Ovchinnikov's version
