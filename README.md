# tictactoe - GUI
tic-tac-toe game in Rust with a GUI using the awesome ggez library

AI uses Minimax algorithm with Alpha Beta pruning to pick best move.
TOODO: need to dumb AI down so the AI is beatable and this is more fun to play rather than just an exercise. Perhaps adding a levels config limiting depth of minimax search and picking some random moves.

Human player starts first with X. AI plays with O.
